#Pub Anywhere
+	A website community to help people to find the best pub anywhere.
+	The application is running on Heroku and we also have an amazon S3 to storage images.
+	Spring Social combined with Spring Security made an easy Log In with Facebook API.
+	The front-end is responsive with Bootstrap and jquery for a user friendly view.
+	Pub Anywhere uses MongoDB, a document type NoSQL database. MongoDB works very well for us, providing a simple way to calculate places in a determined distance. Combining Spring Data and MongoDB, it's possible to use an indexed GeoSpatial to search pubs around within 5km.
+	There is a Selenium solution to register pubs from a determined location (thanks google).
