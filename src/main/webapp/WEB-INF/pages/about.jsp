				<h3>
					Founded in November of 2012, working only through the web.
					<br>
					Pub Anywhere is a community website to help people to find a place to take a beer.
					<br>
					Doesn't matter where you are, we'll help you to find the nearest place. 
					<br><br>
					ps: Note we are currently developing the site, since it's in a <font color="red">BETA</font> version.
					While it's in BETA version, I'm not covering all functions yet, so be patient, I'm working hard on it.
					<br><br>
					Note: For now, I'm just covering English / Portuguese version, but I would like to add German, Chinese, whatever.
					So if you are reading this, and want to help me with something, please, send me an email in Contact,
					correcting some words already written in English or a translated version.

					It's a mistake to say <font color="red">WE</font>... Why? Because it's not <font color="red">WE</font>, its only <font color="red">ME!</font> hehe
					<br>
					My name is Thiago, I'm a senior java developer, looking every day for challenges.
					<br>
					When I'm not coding in my job, I'm coding in my home, when those two things do not happen, 
					I tried to spend as much time as I can with my wife, friends, PS3 and world of warcraft.

					Story
				</h1>
				<h3>
					Some day, I was looking for bars and pubs to take a beer, and could see a lot of potential websites,
					with a lot of contents published etc, but I didn't find a basic finder on the web...
					<br>
					Doesn't matter where am I, I just want to take a beer, and how can I find it?
					<br>
					So I decided to work in my new project: Pub Anywhere!
					<br>
					I know there is others robust websites, with a lot of categories, but not a specific for bars and pubs.
					Well, not anymore, now there is Pub Anywhere!
