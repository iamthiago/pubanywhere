about.pubanywhere.message = Founded in November of 2012, working only through the web.<br>Pub Anywhere is a community website to help people to find a place to take a beer.<br>Doesn't matter where you are, we'll help you to find the nearest place.<br><br>PS: Note we are currently developing the site, since it's in a <font color="red">BETA</font> version.

Because it's not <font color="red">WE</font>, its only <font color="red">ME!</font> hehe <br>My name is Thiago, I'm a java developer, looking every day for challenges.<br>When I'm not coding in my job, I'm coding in my home, when those two things do not happen, I tried to spend as much time as I can with my wife, friends, PS3 and World of Warcraft.

about.story.message = Some day, I was looking for bars and pubs to take a beer, and could see a lot of potential websites, with a lot of contents published etc, but I didn't find a basic finder on the web...<br>Doesn't matter where am I, I just want to take a beer, and how can I find it?<br>So I decided to work in my new project: Pub Anywhere!<br>I know there is others robust websites, with a lot of categories, but not a specific for bars and pubs. Well, not anymore, now there is Pub Anywhere!
